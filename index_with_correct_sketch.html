  <h1>Romeo & Juliet: A Multimodal Project</h1>

  <p>As a high school English teacher currently teaching <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, I wanted to explore how digital tools could help reimagine the play's themes and make them more engaging for students.</p>

  <h2>ðŸŒ¹ðŸ’” Interactive Symbolism</h2>
  <p>This OpenProcessing sketch features a blooming rose and a flashing daggerâ€”symbolizing the tension between love and violence in the play.</p>

  <h2>ðŸŽ­ Comic Strips</h2>
  <p>Each comic strip condenses key emotional moments from the play into four panels. These comics bring the narrative to life in a visual format.</p>

  <h2>ðŸŽ¬ Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Exploring <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> through multimodal tools has allowed me to connect Shakespeareâ€™s timeless themes with the kinds of digital storytelling that resonate with students today. These projects have expanded how I think about literature and how I teach it. The intersection of creativity, technology, and text invites us to experience the playâ€™s emotions and imagine new possibilities for its ending.</p>
